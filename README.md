Day 12 Python Project Courses by Angela Wu : Game Guessing the number 

Today, we didn't have any clue or hint to make this project. I've made it from scratch, i'm pretty happy cause i think i done well and the game works fine.

I didn't face special difficulties, except a little bit to user the return of the function to downgrade number of attempts of the player, bc at first i wanted to code it in brut, but i realize it will be much simpler if the attempts give according to the difficulty choose was in a function.

If you have any advice or comment, fell free to tell me, thank you 


#Number Guessing Game Objectives:

# Include an ASCII art logo.
# Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
# Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer.
# If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
# Track the number of turns remaining.
# If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player.
# Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).
